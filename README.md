# -Digital-Taxi-Fare-Meter
## Problem statement
To design a digital taxi fare meter using Verilog and its implementation in FPGA. This project calculates the distance traveled by the taxi’s wheel andcontinuously displays it. And based on distance travelled it generates fare amount.
## Introduction
A fare meter, also known as a taxi meter or cab meter, is a device used in vehicles for hire, such as taxis, to calculate the fare a passenger owes for a specific journey. Fare meters are essential for ensuring a transparent and standardized way of charging passengers for their transportation services.FPGA stands for Field-Programmable Gate Array. It is a type of integrated circuit (IC) that can be configured and reconfigured by the user to perform a wide range of digital tasks. FPGAs are different from traditional application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) in that they are not designed for a specific purpose during manufacturing but instead can be programmed to perform various tasks after production.
## Motivation
* In digital meter, instead of using mechanical parts, we used formulas to calculate the speed and distance. This is more accurate than the analog meters and doesn’t require any maintenance for long period of time.
* Billing Records: Fare meters usually keep a record of each trip's details, including the distance traveled, time elapsed, and fare charged. This information can be valuable for both drivers and passengers in case 
  of disputes or for tax and accounting purposes.
* Transparency: Fare meters are visible to passengers, displaying the fare as it accumulates during the journey.
## Objectives
* for different cases of distances we check them using test bench for every 100ns.
* Further implement it on FPGA(Field Programmable Gate Array).
